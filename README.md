# Rubik's Streak Timer
A Rubik's cube timer training app to help improve speed!

## Concept
Based off a practice drill concept done by legendary speedcuber [Feliks Zemdegs](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009ZEMD01), the goal of the drill is to continuously complete solves under your global average. The main goal of this drill is to train focus when doing cubing sessions, full focus can lead to eliminating bad solves and gradually lower times.

## Setup
Unfortunately the application is not yet hosted on a proper server. To access and use the application do the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toado/kaboom.git
cd streak-timer 
open ./index.html
```
## How to use
When first opening the application, the user is prompted to enter their global average. This is referring to a goal time to solve under, to properly practice a time slighty above the typical average of 12 of the user should be entered.

Like most Rubik's cube timers the spacebar is used to start and stop the timer. Note that the timer is only ready when the color of the numbers turn green, this is to closely replicate the timer delay on stackmat timers that are used in official WCA competitions.
